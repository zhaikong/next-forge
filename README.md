## Overview

[next-forge](https://github.com/vercel/next-forge) is a production-grade [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) template for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps. It's designed to be a comprehensive starting point for building SaaS applications, providing a solid, opinionated foundation with minimal configuration required.

Built on a decade of experience building web applications, next-forge balances speed and quality to help you ship thoroughly-built products faster.

## Structure

next-forge uses a monorepo structure managed by Turborepo:

```

│   ├── web/        # Marketing website (port 3001)
